# Development

This is a monorepo managed using yarn workspaces and lerna.

Prerequisites:

- `yarn`

## Getting started

Prepare the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:samihult/xjog.git
cd xjog
yarn
```

After this you can run commands like this from the root directory:

```bash
lerna run clean
lerna run build
lerna run lint --scope @samihult/xjog
lerna exec -- cat package.json | jq '.license'
```

To get started with development, build and watch from the root level.

```bash
yarn run watch-all
```

## Versioning and publishing

Please follow the semantic versioning:

- Breaking changes &rarr; major version
- New features &rarr; minor version
- Fixes, documentation &rarr; patch version

All ALPHA versions should be `0.0.x` and BETA versions `0.x.y`.

XJog can be graduated to beta once there is a comprehensive test set and
sufficient documentation.

There are two main ways of versioning and publishing:

```bash
# Version and publish in one go
lerna publish

# Version and publish separately
lerna version
lerna publish from-package
```

While in alpha, packages will be pushed to GitHub packages under the `@samihult` namespace. At graduation, the namespace
will be converted to `@xjog` and the packages will be transferred to an NpmJs repository. In that phase, the publishing
will be managed by a GitHub Actions workflow â€“ in the alpha phase it needs to be done manually.

In order to push to the private GitHub packages repository, you will need a personal access token. Ask repository owners
for access to your GitHub account.

## Issues and branching

No direct changes to `main` are allowed.

The preferred way is to track issues. Please
[link your PR](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
to the issue. Small changes may be accepted without an issue in code review.

Use the following branch naming:

- `docs/very-short-description` for a PR that only contains documentation (no code compilation needed)
- `feature/very-short-description` for new functionality, test or improvement
- `fix/very-short-description` for a bug fix (please add regression tests and make sure they fail before the fix)

## Reviews

Currently, all pull requests require an owner's code review. Reviews by other can speed up the process, so don't shy
away from that.

## Running tests

XJog has undergone a large-scale refactoring to multiple smaller packages and testing framework needs to be rewritten as
well. The idea is to have two kinds of tests:

A) Unit tests

In XJog unit tests are going to be a minority. Only write unit tests where you can extract a functional part that has no
external effects. For example, a simple function that transforms or filters data. For anything more complex, spend your
effort on writing E2E tests.

To run all unit tests:

```bash
lerna run test
```

B) End-to-end tests (E2E)

With end-to-end, the whole stack including the persistence layer, is active. These tests are the most important ones,
since XJog is sensitive to database idiosyncrasies. Also the XJog's lifecycle functionalities play a crucial part in
making everything run reliably and smooth.

### Current state of affairs

Presently, no runnable tests. A rudimentary set of test cases can be found under `tests-int` and `tests-e2e` though.

Integration tests were a set of tests that used a mock adapter, but the upkeep cost of a mock adapter is high. They had
their benefits at the early stages of development, but should be converted to E2E tests now.

Testing should be activated. See the following issues:

- #10
